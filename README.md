# Atomic-Multi-Purpose-Code
AMPC (Atomic-Multi-Purpose-Code) is a C++ framework for numerical calculations on atomistic "toy models".

It features, e.g.,  
- genereric and real atom/ion types  
- common interatomic potentials (EAM, Lennard-Jones, Coulomb, Axilrod-Teller-Muto)  
- cubic and hexagonal crystal structures  
- adjustable homogenous strain tensors

It calculates, e.g.,  
- the total energy of the crystal  
- lattice sums (Madelung constant)  
- elastic constants

Future additions will include:  
- a model for monomers and polymer chains  
- a simple molecular dynamics (MD) solver  
- simulations at finite temperature to calculate statistical properties
